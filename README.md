<h2> Nano text editor configuration files</h2>
</br>
> In this repo are my configuration files for Nano editor including nanorc and some syntax files.  
> I've been using nano as an editor on for some time and I'm posting my configuration so I don't loose.  
> If you see anything you like then take it.  
>  
> I'll also try to add help text as I go and share what I've learnt...  
> It is a good editor for people who don't want to bite off a big chunk of Vim or Emacs but still want to stay in the terminal. This also avoids annoying file permission issues when moving quickly around configure files.  
>  
> Personally I use nano for most things now, even this Markdown file. I've Marker editor open to view the HTML but nano can check the syntax and my spelling if configured correctly.  
> I just starting to setup Linters and formatters so this is why I don't want to loose my efforts.
> I'll document the process and maybe someone will find the information useful.
